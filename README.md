# fullstackellerbeck.com - codebase

I figured my first commit to git should be my own web 
site which utilities the following technologies:
- Bootstrap / jQuery
- LAMP
- CodeIgniter

To-do:
- Administration pages
- More utilization of technology such as Sass or Less

Check back for more experiments and stuff!
