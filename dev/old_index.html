		<h1>Thanks for visiting, but...</h1>
		<p>I'm still getting things set-up. I've been doing these personal sites for a while but client work has taken priority. Now, it's me time.</p>
		<p>Check back for neat stuff.</p>
		<p>All under the covers of course, for the 'view-source' types.</p>
		<!-- Yeah I'm looking at you. The plan here is Angular, Bootstrap, and Node in the back. Time to write some code !-->
		<p>It'll still be pretty, but of course, all the best stuff happens behind the scenes.</p>

		<p>Love,<br />Chris</p>
